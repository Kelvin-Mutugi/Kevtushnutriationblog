            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Proper nutrition before and after a workout can significantly impact your performance, recovery, and overall fitness goals.

            <h2>1. Pre-Workout Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Eating the right foods before exercising can enhance your performance and energy levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Aim to eat a balanced meal or snack about 30 minutes to 2 hours before your workout. This allows time for digestion and prevents discomfort during exercise.</li>
                <li><strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Focus on carbohydrates for energy and moderate protein for muscle support. Avoid heavy or fatty foods that can cause sluggishness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pre-Workout Snack Ideas:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Banana with Peanut Butter: The banana provides quick-digesting carbs, while the peanut butter adds protein and healthy fats.</li>
                <li>Greek Yogurt with Berries: Greek yogurt offers protein, and berries provide antioxidants and carbohydrates.</li>
                <li>Oatmeal with Fruit: Oats are a great source of complex carbohydrates, and adding fruit gives a boost of vitamins and quick energy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Post-Workout Nutrition</h2>
            <p>After exercising, your body needs nutrients to repair muscles, replenish energy, and support recovery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Eat within 30 minutes to 2 hours after your workout to maximize recovery. This helps to replenish glycogen stores and support muscle repair.</li>
                <li><strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Focus on a combination of protein to aid in muscle recovery and carbohydrates to restore energy levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Post-Workout Meal Ideas:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken Breast with Quinoa and Vegetables: Chicken provides lean protein, quinoa offers carbohydrates and additional protein, and vegetables add essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
                <li>Protein Smoothie: Blend protein powder with almond milk, a banana, and a handful of spinach for a quick and nutritious recovery drink.</li>
                <li>Tuna Salad with Whole-Grain Crackers: Tuna provides protein and omega-3 fatty acids, while whole-grain crackers add fiber and carbs for energy replenishment.</li>
                <li>Eggs and Sweet Potatoes: Eggs are rich in protein and essential amino acids, while sweet potatoes offer complex carbohydrates and nutrients for recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Hydration</h2>
            <p>Staying hydrated is essential for optimal performance and recovery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before Exercise:</strong> Drink water throughout the day and consider having a glass about 30 minutes before your workout to ensure you start hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>During Exercise:</strong> For workouts lasting more than an hour, consider sports drinks that replenish electrolytes. For shorter sessions, water is usually sufficient.</li>
                <li><strong>After Exercise:</strong> Rehydrate with water and consider including a beverage with electrolytes if your workout was particularly intense.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Special Considerations</h2>
            <p><strong>Personal Needs:</strong> Individual nutritional needs can vary based on workout intensity, duration, and personal fitness goals. Adjust your pre- and post-workout nutrition based on how your body responds and consult a nutritionist if needed.</p>
            <p><strong>Dietary Restrictions:</strong> For those with dietary restrictions, explore alternative protein sources such as plant-based proteins or fortified dairy-free milk to meet recovery needs.</p>
        </section>

By fueling your body with the right nutrients at the right times, you can improve your energy levels, support muscle repair, and achieve your fitness goals more effectively. Experiment with different foods and timings to find what works best for your body and workout routine.</p>
