                <p>Protein is crucial for building and repairing tissues, making hormones, and supporting immune function. It is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of the body. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts.</p>

                <p>Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. They are broken down into glucose, which is used for fuel. Carbohydrates are found in foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Choose complex carbohydrates for sustained energy and better nutrition.</p>
